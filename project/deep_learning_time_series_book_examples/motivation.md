## Motivation
-----------------

Given a dataset with time series format, we are interested in predicting future values of the given variable based on its history. <p>
Whether it is <font color='green'> univariate or multivariate data, </font> we can apply different modelling techniques, <font color='green'> from an ARIMA based model to a long-short-term-memory network </font>, going also through other models like multilayer perceptron or convolutional neural network.
